# simple password guesser for gpg private keys

This tool could be useful if you forgot 10% of your gpg private key passphrase and want to bruteforce it. Why not use JTR? This has less code, no deps and easier to audit, so you could run it on a production server directly.  
Inspiration obtained from [rephrase](https://roguedaemon.net/rephrase/)  
Converted to python, updated gpg command.
